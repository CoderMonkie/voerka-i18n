export default `VoerkaI18n is a powerful and modern front-end multi-language framework dedicated to providing developers with flexible, efficient, and full-chain internationalization support. Its core advantage lies in its deep integration with the mainstream technology ecosystem, seamlessly supporting front-end frameworks such as Vue, React, SolidJS, and Svelte, while also being compatible with Node.js server-side and native JavaScript projects, truly achieving cross-platform and multi-scenario coverage.
This solution innovatively proposes an "fully automated translation workflow," where intelligent CLI tools automatically scan the source code to extract texts for translation, combined with a visual editor to facilitate collaborative translation, significantly reducing manual maintenance costs. Its runtime dynamic loading capability supports on-demand loading of language packs, greatly optimizing performance. In terms of functionality, in addition to basic variable interpolation, plural rules, and date and currency formatting, it also provides robust context-sensitive translations, micro-translation modes (for precise updates to partial content), and intelligent diagnostic tools that can automatically detect translation coverage and syntax errors.
The groundbreaking design of VoerkaI18n is reflected in its "decentralized" management architecture, allowing developers to decouple translation files from code repositories and achieve cloud collaboration through lightweight APIs. Its type-safe TypeScript support and responsive language switching mechanism further enhance the development experience. Whether for lightweight applications or large-scale projects, VoerkaI18n redefines the paradigm of internationalization development with high scalability and minimal API, making it the ideal choice for global projects.`
