export default `VoerkaI18n is a powerful modern frontend multilingual framework, dedicated to providing developers with flexible, efficient, and end-to-end internationalization support. Its core advantage lies in deep adaptation to mainstream technology ecosystems, offering seamless support for frontend frameworks such as Vue, React, SolidJS, Svelte, compatibility with Node.js server-side projects, and native JavaScript projects, truly achieving cross-platform and multi-scenario coverage.

This solution innovatively proposes an "entirely automated translation workflow," automatically scanning source code to extract texts requiring translation via intelligent CLI tools, combined with a visual editor for collaborative translation efforts, significantly reducing manual maintenance costs. Its runtime dynamic loading capability supports on-demand loading of language packs, markedly optimizing performance. Functionally, beyond basic variable interpolation, pluralization rules, and date/currency formatting, it also provides robust context-sensitive translation, micro-translation mode (precise updates of localized content), and smart diagnostic tools that can automatically detect translation coverage rates and grammatical errors.

The breakthrough design of VoerkaI18n is embodied in its "decentralized" management architecture, allowing developers to decouple translation files from the codebase, enabling cloud collaboration through lightweight APIs. Its type-safe TypeScript support and responsive language switching mechanism further enhance the development experience. Whether for lightweight applications or large-scale projects, VoerkaI18n redefines internationalization development paradigms with high scalability and minimalist APIs, making it the ideal choice for globalized projects.`
