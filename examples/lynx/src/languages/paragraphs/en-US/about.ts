export default `VoerkaI18n is a powerful modern front-end multilingual framework dedicated to providing developers with flexible, efficient, and end-to-end internationalization support. Its core advantage lies in deep adaptation to mainstream technology ecosystems, seamlessly supporting front-end frameworks such as Vue, React, SolidJS, and Svelte, while also being compatible with Node.js server-side and native JavaScript projects, truly achieving cross-platform and multi-scenario coverage.

This solution innovatively proposes an "fully automated translation workflow," where intelligent CLI tools automatically scan the source code to extract text for translation, combined with a visual editor to enable collaborative translation, significantly reducing manual maintenance costs. Its runtime dynamic loading capability supports on-demand loading of language packs, greatly optimizing performance. Functionally, in addition to basic variable interpolation, plural rules, and date/currency formatting, it also provides powerful context-sensitive translation, micro-translation mode (precise updates to localized content), and intelligent diagnostic tools that can automatically detect translation coverage and grammatical errors.

The breakthrough design of VoerkaI18n is embodied in its "decentralized" management architecture, allowing developers to decouple translation files from the codebase and achieve cloud-based collaboration through lightweight APIs. Its type-safe TypeScript support and responsive language-switching mechanism further enhance the development experience. Whether for lightweight applications or large-scale projects, VoerkaI18n redefines the paradigm of internationalization development with high scalability and minimalistic APIs, making it the ideal choice for global projects.`
